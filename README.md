# StoreBook

### Overview

For my 3rd project I built a application that catlogs user info. In the near futer the application will host alerts from
management and coworkers, provide updates on emploiee sceduals, changes of munue items (for restaronts),  local traffic and weither reports. Theres alot left to do with this app. This was built out in an extreamly agale inverment within a week with help from my colleagues, and professers at Ga.
